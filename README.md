# Official Company Website
    
A minimal, static website for the Official Company Website project. This repository contains a single-page site (Index.html) intended to be served as a static site or opened directly in a browser.

## Contents

- `Index.html` — the site's HTML entry point.
- `LICENSE` — project license.

## Quick preview

The fastest way to preview the site is to open `Index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or use your editor's "Open in Browser" feature).

If you prefer a local HTTP server (recommended for testing relative paths and some browser features), run a simple server from the repository root. For example, with Python 3 installed:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or with Node.js installed you can use `npx http-server`:

```powershell
npx http-server -p 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Development

- Edit `Index.html` to change page content, metadata, or links.
- Keep the site simple: this repo is intended as a static, single-file site.

## Deployment

Because this is a static site, it can be hosted on any static-hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, Azure Static Web Apps, etc.). For GitHub Pages, push to the `main` branch and enable Pages in the repository settings.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. For small updates, open a pull request with a concise description of the change. For larger changes please open an issue first to discuss the plan.

## License

This project is licensed under the terms in the `LICENSE` file.
